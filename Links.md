# Useful Links To Have On Hand

## [Israeli Drug Registry (Hebrew Only)](https://www.gov.il/he/service/israeli-drug-index)

Governent repository with official information about drug registrations.

## Facebook Groups, Communities

Israelis love their Facebook groups! There are lots of groups in Hebrew for ADHD but (as is the case in English also) many resources depart from the implicit assumptions that ADHD is only for children (needless to say, not true). It can take a little bit of probing and digging to find the right community if you're an adult but, as always, it's commonly worth the effort. 

A few Hebrew fora

- [Group 1](https://www.facebook.com/groups/142580185805364/)
- [Group 2](https://www.facebook.com/groups/270299419753947/)
- [Group 3](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3269100949854079/)

But if you're reading this you're probably an English speaker. 

In which case there are a few resources that are very helpful:

- [Navigating ADHD In Israel For Anglos](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1533938913525704) - The only "specific" community on Facebook (at least that I'm aware of)

These may help too:

- [Finding Practicioners & Navigating The Israeli Medical System](https://www.facebook.com/groups/845782782185318)

## Kupot Holim

### Maccabi 

[Maccabi Pharm Drug Checker](https://www.maccabi4u.co.il/new/31276/digital-services/medication/inventory_maccabi_pharm/)

Very recommended to check stock before embarking up on a chicken hunt around pharmacies as specific dosages and meds can and do run out!
